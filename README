Subsonic* is a media streaming server that is similar to Plex, but focuses on music rather than video.  I am trying to make a plugin to allow Subsonic streams to be played through Plex.
 
The plugin is available from:
https://github.com/caveatsCode/subsonic.bundle
 
This is a barebones alpha version.  You need to enter your server information in Preferences before using the channel.

To do list:
Search function
Scrobble to last.fm
Shuffle
Other navigation options besides Artist (such as genre, decade)
 
If you test this channel, please let me know what works and what doesn't work for your setup.
 
*You need Subsonic Premium to use this channel.  It currently costs $1 per month from the Subsonic website (http://www.subsonic.org/pages/premium.jsp).
